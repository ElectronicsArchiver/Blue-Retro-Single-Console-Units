# Blue-Retro-Single-Console-Units

I decided to make a few "standalone" Blue retro adapters for the 3DO, TurboGrafx-16 and Gamecube.  

I designed PCBs based off the cable building instructions from https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro.

I have included the Eagle files, gerbers, Solidworks files for the housings and STLs.  Feel free to make you own!
