## Completed Systems

- `Gamecube`
- `3DO`
- `NES`

The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself.

I have created PCBs for other supported systems but have not tested them as I do not have the systems.

I have created an issue for each of the systems that I do not have available for testing.

If you make one please comment in the related issue on any progress / problems.

I am working on Virtual Boy but need to find a cost efficient way to connect it as I am not going to convert mine.
